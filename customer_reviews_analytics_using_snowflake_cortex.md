# Snowflake Cortex AI for Call Center Transcript Analysis

### CodeLab Overview

Duration: 0:03:00

This hands-on lab introduces participants to Snowflake Cortex AIâ€™s ability to extract valuable insights from unstructured documents using large language models. The lab uses real-world examples of call center transcripts stored as PDFs. Participants will explore functions such as [`PARSE_DOCUMENT`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/parse_document), [`COMPLETE`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/complete), [`TRANSLATE`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/translate), [`SENTIMENT`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/sentiment), [`ENTITY_SENTIMENT`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/entity_sentiment), [`SUMMARIZE`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/summarize), and [`EXTRACT_ANSWER`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/extract_answer). These tools empower users to parse, translate, analyze, and query unstructured customer support data to uncover sentiment, highlight issues, and summarize conversations at scale.

Whether you're a data engineer, business analyst, or AI enthusiast, this lab will help you understand how to turn raw documents into structured, actionable data using generative AI.

### What you'll learn

* Upload and manage unstructured documents in Snowflake.
* Extract and transform transcript text with [`PARSE_DOCUMENT`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/parse_document).
* Structure data using prompt engineering and the [`COMPLETE`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/complete) function.
* Translate text with [`TRANSLATE`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/translate).
* Analyze sentiment using [`SENTIMENT`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/sentiment) and [`ENTITY_SENTIMENT`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/entity_sentiment).
* Summarize content with [`SUMMARIZE`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/summarize).
* Extract answers using [`EXTRACT_ANSWER`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/extract_answer).

### Prerequisites

Duration: 0:01:00

To complete this lab, you will need:

* A [Snowflake account](https://trial.snowflake.com/?owner=SPN-PID-452710) in a cloud region where **Snowflake Cortex LLM functions** are supported.

* A Snowflake account in a cloud region where **Snowflake Cortex LLM functions** are supported.

* Basic familiarity with SQL and the Snowflake UI.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Not all Snowflake regions currently support Cortex LLM functions. Use the [LLM Function Availability](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex-overview#llm-function-availability) page to check which cloud regions are supported before creating your account.
