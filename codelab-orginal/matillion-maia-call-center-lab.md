# Matillion Maia: Call Center AI Agents

## Overview

Duration: 0:03:00

### Introduction

In this quickstart, youâ€™ll sign up for Matillionâ€™s Data Productivity Cloud and prepare your environment for call center analytics with Maia. Youâ€™ll create an account, choose your region and experience, and (optionally) connect a Snowflake trial warehouse so you can start building pipelines in minutes.

This hands-on lab demonstrates how to use **Matillion Maia** to transform call center data from raw audio transcripts using Snowflake Cortex AI functions. Youâ€™ll learn to ingest, transcribe, enrich, and structure audio recordings (`.wav`, `.mp3`) and transcript documents (`.txt`, `.pdf`) directly in Snowflake. With functions like `AI_TRANSCRIBE`, `SUMMARIZE`, `SENTIMENT`, `AI_SENTIMENT`, `AI_CLASSIFY`, `AI_COMPLETE`, and `EXTRACT_ANSWER`, youâ€™ll unlock actionable insights from unstructured conversations and build advanced analytics pipelines.

* Convert call recordings into searchable transcripts.
* Summarize long conversations into concise overviews.
* Measure overall and entity-specific sentiment.
* Classify call types by intent (complaint, query, sales, cancellation, etc.).
* Extract key answers like customer name, call reason, or resolution.
* Generate structured insights, action items, and follow-ups using completions.

In addition, you will:

* Deploy a **Cortex Search Service** to perform contextual, vector-based retrieval across transcripts.
* Use **Cortex Analyst** to enable guided, natural language Q&A on call data.

By the end of this lab, you will have transformed **raw call recordings** into **actionable business intelligence**, equipping analysts and support managers with the ability to identify trends, improve service quality, and uncover insights faster.

## Configure Snowflake
Duration: 0:04:00

### Learning Outcome
Create the core Snowflake resources needed to run the AI Lab. This includes a database, warehouse, schemas, and a stage for uploading audio and transcript files.

### Download Script
Download the source code for this step [here](https://github.com/datalabsolutions/AI-Labs/blob/main/snowflake-snowflake-intelligence-callcenter-lab/scripts/01-AI-LAB-CONFIGURATION.sql).

### Description
This setup script prepares your Snowflake environment to ingest and process unstructured call center data.

* `CREATE DATABASE` ensures your lab operates in a clean, isolated environment.
* `CREATE WAREHOUSE` provisions compute resources for your queries and is configured to minimize cost via automatic suspend/resume.
* `CREATE SCHEMA` creates logical namespaces for raw files (`RAW`), processed/intermediate data (`STAGE`), and consolidated analytics objects (`ANALYTICS`).
* `CREATE STAGE` sets up a secure location to upload audio and transcript documents (`.mp3`, `.wav`, `.pdf`, `.txt`), supports directory-style access, and uses Snowflakeâ€‘managed encryption.

### Step 1: Create the Database
This command creates a database named `CALL_CENTER_DB` if it doesnâ€™t already exist. Using `IF NOT EXISTS` ensures the script is idempotent and safe to rerun.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS CALL_CENTER_DB;
```

### Step 2: Create a Compute Warehouse

This step provisions a warehouse named `USER_STD_XSMALL_WH` with costâ€‘efficient settings:

* Size: `XSMALL` â€” small and costâ€‘effective for light workloads.
* Type: `STANDARD` â€” supports most use cases.
* Auto Suspend: `60` seconds â€” saves credits after inactivity.
* Auto Resume: `TRUE` â€” resumes automatically on query.
* Initially Suspended: `TRUE` â€” starts paused until needed.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE USER_STD_XSMALL_WH
WITH
    WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'
    WAREHOUSE_TYPE = 'STANDARD'
    AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
    AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
    INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE;

CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE APP_STD_XSMALL_WH
WITH
    WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'
    WAREHOUSE_TYPE = 'STANDARD'
    AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
    AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
    INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE;
```

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Auto-suspend after 60 seconds prevents unnecessary credit usage. Auto-resume ensures queries always run when needed.

### Step 3: Create Required Schemas

Schemas help organize your database objects.

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS CALL_CENTER_DB.RAW;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS CALL_CENTER_DB.STAGE;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS CALL_CENTER_DB.ANALYTICS;
```

* `RAW` stores the ingested audio and transcript files.
* `STAGE` is used for parsed, structured, or AI-enriched data.
* `ANALYTICS` is reserved for semantic views, aggregated results, and reporting tables.

Using `IF NOT EXISTS` prevents duplication errors and makes the script safe to rerun.

### Step 4: Create an Internal Stage for Uploads

The internal stage is where you will upload audio files. 

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE CALL_CENTER_DB.RAW.INT_STAGE_DOC_RAW
    DIRECTORY = ( ENABLE = true )
    ENCRYPTION = ( TYPE = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE' );
```
> ðŸ”’ **Note:** Files uploaded here are secured with Snowflakeâ€™s Server-Side Encryption (SSE).



### Step 4: Create Matillion User and Role

The internal stage is where you will upload audio files. 

```sql
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS APP_MATILLION_ROLE;

-- Assign application role to SYSADMIN (best practice)
GRANT ROLE APP_MATILLION_ROLE TO ROLE SYSADMIN;

-- Create user
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS APP_MATILLION_SVC
  TYPE = LEGACY_SERVICE                           -- Explicitly mark as service account
  PASSWORD = 'M@tillion!1.'
  DEFAULT_ROLE = APP_MATILLION_ROLE
  DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = APP_STD_XSMALL_WH
  MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD = FALSE             -- Not required for service users
  COMMENT = 'Service account for Matillion ETL operations';

-- Assign role to user
GRANT ROLE APP_MATILLION_ROLE TO USER APP_MATILLION_SVC;

-- Database & schema usage
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE CALL_CENTER_DB TO ROLE APP_MATILLION_ROLE;
GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE CALL_CENTER_DB TO ROLE APP_MATILLION_ROLE;

-- Warehouse usage
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE APP_STD_XSMALL_WH TO ROLE APP_MATILLION_ROLE;

-- Stage usage
GRANT READ ON STAGE CALL_CENTER_DB.RAW.INT_STAGE_DOC_RAW TO ROLE APP_MATILLION_ROLE;
GRANT WRITE ON STAGE CALL_CENTER_DB.RAW.INT_STAGE_DOC_RAW TO ROLE APP_MATILLION_ROLE;

-- Table privileges (all current + future tables)
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA CALL_CENTER_DB.RAW TO ROLE APP_MATILLION_ROLE;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA CALL_CENTER_DB.STAGE TO ROLE APP_MATILLION_ROLE;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA CALL_CENTER_DB.ANALYTICS TO ROLE APP_MATILLION_ROLE;

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA CALL_CENTER_DB.RAW TO ROLE APP_MATILLION_ROLE;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA CALL_CENTER_DB.STAGE TO ROLE APP_MATILLION_ROLE;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA CALL_CENTER_DB.ANALYTICS TO ROLE APP_MATILLION_ROLE;


```

### Step 6: Upload Files to the Stage

Your internal stage `CALL_CENTER_DB.RAW.INT_STAGE_DOC_RAW` is now set up.

1. In Snowsight, go to **Databases**.
2. Select `CALL_CENTER_DB` â†’ `RAW` â†’ **Stages**.
3. Click on `INT_STAGE_DOC_RAW`.
4. Click **+ Files** and upload one or more audio recordings (MP3/WAV).

> ðŸ”’ **Note:** The zip file that you [downloaded](https://github.com/datalabsolutions/AI-Labs/blob/a27daf7c5d6f72949cc73c820351348d755bbd9c/snowflake-snowflake-intelligence-callcenter-lab/assets/audio_files/audio-files.zip?raw=1) will need to be unzipped.  You need to upload the individual files.
